# Penalty Shootout Game

After spending some time learning how to switch between different cameras in the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/) and learning more about colliders , triggers and sound. An idea of creating a humble soccer penalty shootout game came to mind and I took on the challenge. 

The result is this 3D game that has some humble graphics to make the soccer field and the goal post look somewhat realistic , all created with materials from Unity itself. The game consists of a first person point of view behind a ball and an arrow that is constantly moving from left to right. When the player decides that the arrow is aimed directly at the goal post and decides the shoot the ball , the arrow disappears and the ball moves forward in the direction of the arrow. The camera shows the ball moving in action.

If the ball finds its way inside the goal post , a crowd cheers the player on and the level increments by 1. The ball is then reinitialized randomly at a certain place away from the goal post on the field and the player will have to score another goal. Every three levels that the player passes , the speed that the arrow moves left to right in increases in an attempt to make it more difficult for the player to shoot the ball at a good angle to score a goal. 


The buttons M , L , & R can be used to switch between the main camera  and the left and right side cameras if the player wished to get a better view of the field relative to where the ball is.
